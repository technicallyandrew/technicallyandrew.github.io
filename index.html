<!-- To Fix:
1. Organization needs a lot of work.
2. I still don't fully understand why the fade effect is positioned properly with position:relative active on b3, but totally breaks when I remove it. 
Currently, I would expect that to not matter since position:relative isn't set for the other box items >.<
3. Pretty sure there's no reason to have the text-wrapper inside of h2 in order to get the positioning I want, will have to experiment with that later.
4. Need to make some sort of pre-visualization in After Effects or other editing software so I actually know where this is going. 
Current Ideas:
Other interests that appear after "Loves" should have their own unique color or icon. 3D Art could be the Blender logo, 
photography an instagram logo or camera, and videography the youtube logo or a film reel.
5. There needs to be some sort of background animation to make things more exciting and less drab. 
Friendly reminder to future Sean to remember drop-shadows exist and are great to separate items from solid backgrounds.
6. Add comments to the actual code itself, especially the CSS. This is going to be really confusing to review in the future if I don't.
